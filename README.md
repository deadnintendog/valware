# valware

this script is a valentine's day gift.

it performs the following actions:

> 1.) echo "happy valentine's day <3" to the console.
> 
> 2.) populate the desktop with files.
> 
> 3.) remove a subset of created files, leaving behind file icons arranged in the outline of a heart.
> 
> 4.) remaining files are then populated with text containing heartfelt sentiments.

this is hard-coded for my kali linux virtal machine desktop with 4 icons already present.

dynamically adjusting for the desktop layout of any intended recipient is intended as a work in progress! :]
